# Features

## Limits battery charge to an upper limit

Modern batteries deteriorate more when always kept at full charge. For this reason, Apple introduced the “Optimized Charging“ feature for all their portable devices, including Macs. However, its limit cannot be changed, and you cannot force charging to be put on hold. Ampere allows specifying a hard limit past which battery charging will be turned off. For safety reasons, this limit cannot be lower than 50&nbsp;%.

## Allows battery charge to drain to a lower limit

Even when connected to power, your Mac's battery may slowly lose battery charge for various reasons. Short battery charging bursts can further deteriorate batteries. For this reason, Ampere allows specifying a limit only below which battery charging will be turned on. For safety reasons, this limit cannot be lower than 20&nbsp;%.

**Note:** This setting is not honoured for cold boots or reboots, because Apple Silicon Macs reset their platform state in these cases. As battery charging will already be ongoing when Ampere starts, it lets charging proceed to the upper limit to not cause further short bursts across reboots.

## Allows you to disable the power adapter

If you want to discharge the battery of your Mac, e.g., to recalibrate it, you can turn off the power adapter without actually unplugging it. You can also have Ampere disable sleeping when the power adapter is disabled.

**Note:** Your Mac may go to sleep immediately after enabling the power adapter again. This is a software bug in macOS and cannot easily be worked around.

## Grants you manual control

The Ampere "Commands" menu and its menu bar extra allow you to issue various commands related to the power state of your Mac. These include:
* Enabling and disabling the power adapter
* Requesting a full charge
* Requesting a charge to the specified upper limit
* Stopping charging immediately
* Pausing all background activity

# Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ampere currently only supports Apple Silicon Macs [#15](https://github.com/flschr/ampere/issues/15)

### Manual Install
1. Go to the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/flschr/ampere/releases/latest) page
2. Download the latest non-dSYM build (i.e., `Ampere-X.Y.zip`)
3. Unzip the archive
4. Drag `Ampere.app` into your Applications folder

### Install via Homebrew :beer:
Homebrew distribution is not available for Ampere yet. Use the manual install
until an Ampere tap or cask is published.

### Opening the App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step is necessary, because the app has not been notarized by Apple due to the membership fees of the Apple Developer Program. "Apple could not verify 'Ampere.app' is free of malware" refers to the [lack of notarizaion](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445), not to any anomalies detected.

On macOS 14 Sonoma or below:
1. Right click `Ampere.app`
2. Click "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the dialog box

On macOS 15 Sequoia or above:
1. Try to open the app, it will tell you it's blocked
2. Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and scroll to the bottom
3. Click "Open Anyway" to allow Ampere to open
4. Click "Open Anyway" on the next dialog box and authenticate
5. Open Ampere again from Applications folder

# Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> To ensure there is no chance of interference, please turn “Optimized Charging” **off** when Ampere is in use. <br>
>  Go to macOS System Settings > Battery > the (i) next to Battery Health > Optimized Battery Charging > toggle off

1. Open Ampere from your Applications folder
2. The menu bar will change to show the app menus, and a menu bar extra will should be visible
3. Configure the settings through either method (see **Fig. 2, 3, 4**)

If you prefer, you can quit the GUI to hide the menu bar extra and Ampere will keep running in the background.
If you want to change any settings, simply re-open the app.

# Uninstall

1. Focus Ampere
2. Open the main Ampere menu in the menu bar (see **Fig. 3**)
3. Choose "Disable Background Activity"
4. Move the app to the Trash and empty it

# Limitations

Ampere disables sleep while it is charging, because it has to actively disable charging once reaching the maximum. Sleep is re-enabled once charging is stopped for any reason, e.g., reaching the maximum charge level, manual cancellation, or unplugging the MacBook.

Apps, including Ampere, cannot control the charge state when the machine is shut down. If the charger remains plugged in while the Mac is off, the battery will charge to 100&nbsp;%.

Note that sleep should usually be disabled when the power adapter is disabled, as this will exit Clamshell mode and the machine will sleep immediately if the lid is closed. Refer to the toggle in the Settings dialog (see **Fig. 1**).

# Technical Details

* Based on IOPowerManagement events to minimize resource usage, especially when not connected to power
* Support for macOS Ventura daemons and login items for a more reliable experience

## Security
* Privileged operations are authenticated by the daemon
* Privileged daemon exposes only a minimal protocol via XPC
* XPC communication uses the latest macOS codesign features
